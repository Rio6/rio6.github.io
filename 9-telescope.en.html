<p>I needed a project for metalwork class, so I made a telescope. I've actually made one some years back with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316214002/https://www.ylib.com/scientific/activity/201311Telescopediy/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Wu Jiun-Huei's Telescope DIY Camp</a>, although that was basically putting together pre-made materials from an existing design. This time, I want to do the designs and size calculation.</p>
<p>Since it's for metalwork class, the telescope would be made from metal. After some browsing around the internet, I found <a href="https://garyseronik.com/a-converted-starblast-travelscope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this design by Gary Seronik</a>. The design looks pretty neat, so I'm basing mine off from his. Although this design only have a 4 1/2" primary mirror, and my previous telescope is a 114mm already, so I figured might as well make a bigger one this time. After some calculation on paper and looking at a measuring tape (so I actually know how long 1 meter is in real life), I decided to make a telescope with an aperature of 150mm and focal length of 750mm. <a href="https://stellafane.org/tm/newt-web/newt-web.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Newt for the Web</a> and <a href="http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/diagonal.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diagonal Off-Axis Illumination Calculator</a> was also very helpful for calculation.</p>

<p>The structure of the telescope is pretty simple. Rolling two pieces of aluminum sheet and holding them with rivets creates the tubes on the end, connected with an L shaped aluminum bar. Primary and seconday mirror holder are also based on Seronik's design, I made them with CNC machine and 3D printer.</p>

<p>Since I've never grinded a mirror myself, and I don't have tools for that, I bought them on <a href="https://agenaastro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AgenaAstro</a> - a GSO 6" f/5 primary and a 50mm seconday. And I got some eye pieces from Taobao.</p>
<p>Making the focuser took me longer. I originally wanted to use 3D printer to print a folding focuser. But my first design wiggles too much, and the knob couldn't even move the focuser. Plus, a pandemic just happened and shut down the school, so no more 3D printing for me to make an updated version. Didn't find much materials to make a simple Crayford focuser at home either, so ended up using a pipe adapter as a focuser. Works good enough.</p>

Found some pipes to make a Crayford focuser, not too bad.

<p>2021/7/13 Update:<br>
I got a new <a href="https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-3-pro-3d-printer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creality Ender-3 Pro</a> 3D printer, so I spent some time designing a new focuser for the telescope.
It was designed in Solidworks, but the license from school expire midway through I was basically locked out from my own files. I had to remote desktop into school's computer to finish it…  I think I'll try to avoid using these expensive programs in the future.</p>

<p>Collimation was done using eye balls - if it looks aligned, it is aligned. The primary mirror can be adjusted with a few knobs, the curved spider holding the secondary are adjusted by bending it by hand, then screws for finer adjustment. When doing that, I found that I made the secondary holder too long, so I had to cut of like half a centimeter from the top.</p>
<p>Using this telescope feels pretty good. I only have plastic tripods, so things are a little bit shaky. And it gets affected by local light sources a lot since there's nothing in its middle secion. But looking at Saturn, Jupiter, Moon, etc, is pretty clear. It's brighter and has a wider field of view compared to my old one. Taking a picture is kind of annoying, though. I tried to attach a webcam to the focuser for pictures, but I didn't like the result. Then I discovered this phone eye piece mount thing, so I made one myself so I can take pictures with my phone.</p>

<p>Here are some photos I got. Got a lot of light pollution near my house, plus my phone is not a professional camera, so I only took pictures of bright, intra solar system objects. I used video recording and gathered hundreds to a couple thousand frames, then used <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PIPP</a> =&gt; <a href="https://www.autostakkert.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autostakkert</a> =&gt; <a href="https://www.astronomie.be/registax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RegiStax</a> =&gt; <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GIMP</a> to do stacking, colour balance, and sharpening. Still a noob so the results are crappy (and I think I didn't set the camera app to the highest resolution). At least you can tell which objects are in the pictures. When looking through the telescope directly though, I could see a lot of stars that aren't visible to naked eyes. Andromeda galaxy was very faint, Neowise was brighter than it.</p>

<p>To conclude: making a telescope is fun, I'll see if I can make an automatic tracking mount for it in the future.</p></div>
