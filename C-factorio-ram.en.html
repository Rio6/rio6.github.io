<!-- {{{ Summary -->
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Factorio is a game of building and maintaining factories. It has a Turing
complete circuit network that resembles real-life digital circuit. A multi-port
RAM is a memory device that can be read from or written to in any order at the
same time. This report aims to provide a design of multi-port RAM in the game
that is easy to interface, high speed, cost efficient, and extendable.</p>
<p>The circuit network in Factorio are made from components such as arithmetic
combinator, decider combinator, constant combinator, and wires. These components
carries signals, which are key-value pairs the system operates on. Combinators
take in input signals, and output new transformed signals. These together
creates a Turing complete system. These operations are performed synchronously
every game tick (60 ticks per second), and dummy combinators may be needed to
make sure two sets of signals travel through different paths arrive at the same
time.</p>
<p>The considerations for this RAM design includes concurrent operation -- the
ability to read and write at the same time; operation speed -- the rate the
input can change while maintaining normal operations; latency -- the delay from
input being set and output being available; multi-signal support -- storing
multiple signals on the same cell; combinator usage; and ease of construction.</p>
<p>The design consists of individual cells linked together by 4 wires: write
address, write data, read address, read data. Each cell contains three
decider combinators. One with feedback input acts as the core memory storage
with reset condition, one handles the write addressing, and one handles read
addressing. Additional combinators can be added to provide more read ports.
Multi-signal support can be added with the cost of <code>n+1</code> additional combinators.
Automatic address assignment can be added with the cost of <code>n</code> additional
combinators. <code>n</code> is the number of cells.</p>
<p>By using the in-game debug menu and test circuit, different properties can be
measured or characterized. The design has a read latency of 1 tick and write
latency of 2 ticks, which are the minimum possible times using circuits.  During
concurrent read/write, the old content is read from the cell before new data is
written. The RAM has an operational speed of 1 change per tick, or 60 changes
per second and is the fastest speed achievable in game.</p>
<p>In the end, the design satisfies the objective, and is practical to use in game.
An application example is provided in <a href="#secapp">Application Example: Train Content Tracking</a>, showing the design
being used to keep track of train content.</p>

<!-- {{{ Introduction -->
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Factorio has a circuit network system that resembles digital circuit in
real-life. Memory storage is one of the real life device that can be implemented
with digital circuit, and it can also be useful in the game. This report
explores the idea of combining the two together to create a RAM in Factorio.</p>
<h3 id="factorio">Factorio</h3>
<p>Factorio is a game of building and maintaining factories. The players have to
combine simple elements into ingenious structures <a href="#ref-factorio">[1]</a>. One of the
big elements in game is a Turing complete circuit network system to help control
and manage the factories. Most of the time, simple circuits are sufficient. But
in a game of creativity and challenge, more complicated circuit becomes
necessary. Figure 1 shows an example of Pong implemented in game
<a href="#vid-pong">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multiportram">Multi-port RAM</h3>
<p>Multi-port random access memory, or multi-port RAM, is a type of memory that can
be read or written to in any order at the same time <a href="#wiki-ram">[3]</a><a href="#wiki-dpram">[4]</a>.
Typically, there would be one write port plus one or more read ports. This type
of memory is more complicated than simple SR-latches or counter (in fact, it
would contain a large quantity of them). However, this added complexity allows
it to be used in situations where individual latches don't suffice.</p>
<h3 id="problemdefinition">Problem Definition</h3>
<p>Factorio has a circuit network that allows player to build complicated
behaviours in their factories. In cases, multiple of circuits networks may want
to store and share information with each other. This storage device needs to be
able to be written to and read from at the same time. This property is similar
to a multi-port RAM in real-world.</p>
<p>An in-game analogue of multi-port RAM can be constructed in game using the
circuit network components, but it is only practical if it is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to build</strong> - the design can be built anywhere with minimal work in a short time.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> - it should be as fast as possible to avoid being the bottleneck of the whole system, this includes both the operational speed and data latency.</li>
<li><strong>Cost efficient</strong> - construction should not need excessive resources, as those are limited in game. This includes space requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Extendable</strong> - different application requires different sizes of data to be stored. The design should be able to accommodate any size.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application of this device is purely in game, and there is no relative
standard published yet either but the developer or players, an application
example is included in <a href="#secapp">Application Example: Train Content Tracking</a> to demonstrate the practicality of
the design.</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>This report aims to provide the information on relevant game mechanics,
definitions of design properties, considerations, and implementation detail of a
multi-port RAM in Factorio. The end result is analyzed to ensure it satisfies
the requirement outlined in <a href="#problem-definition">Problem Definition</a>. Other properties such as
concurrent read-write behaviour are also characterized and documented.</p>

<!-- {{{ Factorio Circuit Network -->
<h2 id="factoriocircuitnetwork">Factorio Circuit Network</h2>
<p>This section describes the basic mechanics of Factorio's circuit network. More
detailed information can be found on Factorio Wiki <a href="#wiki-circuit">[5]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="signals">Signals</h3>
<p>The circuit network is built around the concept of signals. Each signal has an
identifier (represented in game as either items, single letters, single digits,
or a colour) and a value <a href="#wiki-circuit">[5]</a>. Figure 2(a) shows the some of the
signals in the signal selection menu. Figure 2(b) shows how the game represents the
values of signals.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 35%; vertical-align: top"><p></p><center>(a) List of signals in the virtual signal tab</center>
<img src="img/factorio-ram/signals.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/signals.png.webp" loading="lazy"><p></p></div>
<div markdown="1" style="width: 30%; vertical-align: top"><p></p><center>(b) Examples of signals in game</center>
<img src="img/factorio-ram/signals_pole.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/signals_pole.png.webp" loading="lazy"><p></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 2 Examples of signals in game</center><p></p>
<p>These signals carries all the states in the circuit. The signals are updated
every game tick, which is 60 times per second. Changing the state of each signal
in each game ticks essentially creates a sequential logic circuit
<a href="#wiki-combtut">[6]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="combinators">Combinators</h3>
<p>Combinators are the core logic elements of the circuit network. There are three
types of combinators: arithmetic, decider, and constant. Arithmetic combinator,
as the name implies, carries out arithmetic operations on signals, including the
4 elemental operations, exponentiation, and bitwise operations
<a href="#wiki-arithcomb">[7]</a>; decider combinator compare signals, with operations
equals, not equals, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater
than or equal to <a href="#wiki-decicomb">[8]</a>. Constant combinator is much easier, it
can be configured to output a constant value on specified signals
<a href="#wiki-constcomb">[9]</a>. Figure 3 shows the combinator menu in game
and the available operations can be performed by arithmetic and decider
combinators.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 40%"><p></p><center>Arithmetic combinator</center>
<img src="img/factorio-ram/arith_comb.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/arith_comb.png.webp" loading="lazy"><p></p></div>
<div markdown="1" style="width: 40%"><p></p><center>Decider combinator</center>
<img src="img/factorio-ram/deci_comb.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/deci_comb.png.webp" loading="lazy"><p></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 3 Combinators UI in game</center><p></p>
<p>In addition, the combinators can process multiple signals at once. The
arithmetic has a special signal called <em>Each</em>. When it is selected, the
operation is operated on each signal independently. Similarly, the decider
combinator has special signals <em>Each</em>, <em>Everything</em>, <em>Anything</em> that allows it
to compare multiple signals at once <a href="#wiki-circuit">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>These combinator are used in almost all circuit network in game, and are what
makes the circuit system Turing complete.</p>
<h3 id="secmob">Multiple Output Behaviour</h3>
<p>When multiple sets of signal are output to the same wire, the values from each
set are added together (with 0 representing empty signals) <a href="#wiki-circuit">[5]</a>.
For example, when signal set <code>{A: 1, B: 2}</code> and <code>{A: 3, C: 4}</code> are output to
the same wire, the input connected to that wire would read <code>{A: 4, B: 2, C:
4}</code>. This mechanics often allows addition operation without requiring extra
combinator, and is an important feature for many counter and timer designs.
Figure 4 shows a simple counter design utilizing this mechanic.</p>

<p></p><center>Figure 4 Simple 0 to 9 counter design</center><p></p>
<h3 id="wirecolours">Wire Colours</h3>
<p>In the game, there are 2 colours of wires (green and red) that carries the
signals. This allows two independent set of signals to be connected to same
combinator input without affecting each other. Essentially, connections of each
red and green wires form two independent circuit networks <a href="#wiki-circuit">[5]</a>.
Figure 5 shows an example of a circuit using multiple wires. Note
when both wires contain the same signal are connected to the input of a
combinator, the combinator receives the sum of two signal sets as described in
<a href="#secmob">Multiple Output Behaviour</a>.</p>

<p></p><center>Figure 5 Example circuit using two wire colours</center><p></p>
<p>Being able to connect more than one set of signals to an input provides a lot of
freedom in terms of routing signals, and in many cases, reduces the combinators
required in a circuit, which leads to reduced latency. However since only 2
colours are available, it is also a constraint to consider when designing
circuits.</p>
<h3 id="propagationdelayandsynchronization">Propagation Delay and Synchronization</h3>
<p>In Factorio, signal propagation through the wires are instant. However, the
combinators have a one tick delay. This is the main source of latency in any
circuit. This is one of the reasons why the number of combinators used should be
minimized. The more combinators used in a signal path, the larger the latency
is.</p>
<p>The delays also adds another design consideration. In Factorio, signals are all
in the same clock domain (in-game 60 ticks per second clock), and there is no
metastability issue like real world FPGAs. But if two sets of signals goes
through different number of combinators in their path, they would receive
different amount of delay <a href="#wiki-combtut">[6]</a>. This property can be used to
construct edge detectors like the one in Figure 6. When the
constant combinator starts output a signal (set by players), the data would be
on the green wire for one tick, then gets subtracted back to zero as the
arithmetic combinator outputs the negated value in next tick.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 15%"><p><img src="img/factorio-ram/edge.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/edge.png.webp" loading="lazy"></p></div>

<p></p><center>Figure 6 An edge detector circuit</center><p></p>
<p>However, most of the time this desynchronization can cause undesired data to
appear in the circuit for a few game ticks. At best case, it slows down the
speed of the circuit; worst case the bad data propagates across the network and
can be hard to debug.  That's why it is a common practice to add a dummy gate,
like addition by 0, to match the timing of each circuit. Figure 7
shows an example of such circuit.</p>

<!-- {{{ Design Considerations -->
<h2 id="ramdesignconsiderations">RAM Design Considerations</h2>
<p>This section defines some of the metrics and properties to be considered when
designing the Factorio RAM.</p>
<h3 id="concurrentoperations">Concurrent Operations</h3>
<p>Concurrent operations specifies the ability for a RAM to be written to and read
from at the same time. Usually there would be one port on the RAM to write to,
and one or more ports to read from. This type of RAM is also called dual-port or
multi-port RAM. Being able to read and write at the same time allows
communication between a data writer and multiple independent readers. This
property makes dual-port RAM a much more suitable memory storage in many
situations.</p>
<h3 id="operationspeed">Operation Speed</h3>
<p>The operating speed is a metric of how fast the input can update while
maintaining normal operation. The maximum speed achievable in the game is one
update per game tick, which is 60 per second in normal settings. This speed is
usually determined by how much desync is present in the circuit. The more
difference there is between two signals, the more time the whole circuit needs
for the output value to settle. This is different than FPGAs where the speed is
usually constrained by the critical path <a href="#fpga-path">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>Since a circuit can still take input at lower speed than its maximum, having one
that is capable of running at maximum game speed essentially gives the input an
unconstrained timing. This makes it much useful in situations where the input
can be unpredictable, for example, the signal generated by individual items
transported on a belt.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>Latency is the delay from the input being set and the output being available. In
this RAM design, there are to metrics to measure: read latency and write
latency.</p>
<p>Read latency is the delay between read address being set and data being
available at output. The best case would be a latency of 1 - data becomes
available at the tick following the address. This can be achieved easily in most
designs since usually there's only one decider combinator that outputs data
based on input address.</p>
<p>Write latency is the delay between data write and data being available at the
reading side. It's more challenging to achieve a latency of 1 in this case,
since minimum of one combinator is needed to latch the data, and the other one
being the read address decider. That is, a latency of 2 would be a more
practical latency for writing.</p>
<p>Another important property to consider is the consistency of latency. A RAM that
has address dependent or time dependent latency makes it hard to use. Additional
data available signal might be required to notify the RAM user since there's no
fixed amount of delay to wait for. In any case, a RAM with constant latency for
each operation is a far better design than without.</p>
<h3 id="secmss">Multi-signal Support</h3>
<p>This is a Factorio specific property. As mentioned in <a href="#combinators">Combinators</a>,
both types of combinators in the game supports operating on multiple signals at
the same time. This allows RAM designs that can store multiple signals in one
cell. It is a useful feature to have, especially when the RAM is used with the
rest of the factory. Most of the control and status report in Factorio uses
different signals at the same time (for example, a chest can report its content
using the signal set <code>{iron plate: 36, copper plate: 20, coal: 10}</code>).
If the RAM can only store one signal, its usefulness would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>However, the addition of multi-signal into the RAM circuit adds additional
complexity. Since the combinators would pass all signals through itself,
additional filters would be needed to prevent control signals from reaching
the output, increasing the combinator usage. <a href="#secmssimpl">Variation: Multi-signal Support</a>
describes the required design in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="combinatorusage">Combinator Usage</h3>
<p>This is the measurement of combinators used per cell. Memory cells are used as
unit instead of data size, since each cell has a possibility of storing more than
one signal as described in <a href="#secmss">Multi-signal Support</a>. This metric is important when the RAM
circuit is scaled up. Two extra combinator used in each scale in a 100-cell RAM
means an extra of 200 combinators are added into the design. While space and
energy in Factorio is relatively cheap, the upscaling would eventually be
limited by the physical computer running the game. As each combinator requires
CPU resource to computer, minimizing the combinator count is essential for
constructing a large circuit.</p>
<h3 id="easeofconstruction">Ease of Construction</h3>
<p>Factorio is a game designed for players to play. In the game, player would have
to place all the individual combinators and wires, and configure them
accordingly. Factorio has an excellent UI/UX for copying and mass configuring
entities (eg., combinators) in game. This in turns causes the best design for
construction to be one that can be easily copied. However, this can conflicts
with other considerations, namely combinator usage. A design with the address
if each cell preconfigured in its combinators would have a minimal combinator
count, but each combinator would need to be configured separately. In contrary,
a design where each cell have external address line that gets automatically
incremented (as described in <a href="#secautoaddr">Variation: Automatic Address
Assignment</a>) is much easier to construct, but requires one
additional (or more, in case of multi-signal supported is needed) per cell. This
is a design trade off that needs to be considered in each situation.</p>
<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ Design Detail -->
<h2 id="designdetail">Design Detail</h2>
<p>At the top level, this RAM has one wire to carry write address, one to carry
data input, one to carry read address, and one wire to carry data output.
The number of read address and data output wires can be expanded at the cost of
one combinator per pair. If having read address present on data line is not a
concern, those two wire can be combined together. Alternatively, the read
address wire on multiple output port can be combined if the read signal is
different for each port.</p>
<p>The input wire contains a write address signal <code>W</code> and a write data
signal. In single signal mode, the signal <code>D</code> is used for write data
signal. In multi signal mode, any set of signals that is not used for addressing
can be data signal. Then <code>W</code> signal is present, the data is stored into
the corresponding memory cell and becomes available to read.</p>
<p>When the <code>R</code> signal is present in the read address wire, data from the
corresponding cell would be available on the output data wire.</p>
<p>The rest of the section describes the implementation detail of this design.</p>
<h3 id="basicmemorycell">Basic Memory Cell</h3>
<p>The most basic memory cell is one signal combinator looped back to itself. The
input data is carried in signal <code>D</code>. The signal can only be present for
one tick, otherwise the mechanics described in <a href="#secmob">Multiple Output Behaviour</a> would cause
the data to multiply each tick.</p>
<p>Figure 8 shows the in game construction and diagram of this circuit.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 15%"><p><img src="img/factorio-ram/cell.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/cell.png.webp" loading="lazy"></p></div>

</span></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 8 Simplest memory device in Factorio</center><p></p>
<p>An <code>R</code> signal is used as reset signal. When the signal becomes non-zero,
the combinator gets disabled and thus the loop back stops.</p>
<p>The rest of the RAM is designed around this basic memory circuit.</p>
<h3 id="writeaddressing">Write Addressing</h3>
<p>To make the memory circuit easier to use for RAM, two things need to be added:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stored value is cleared when new write address is asserted</li>
<li>The new value is only held for one tick after write address is deasserted</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 9 shows a circuit that achieves the requirements.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 20%"><p><img src="img/factorio-ram/write.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/write.png.webp" loading="lazy"></p></div>
<div markdown="1" style="width: 30%"><p><span style="filter: invert(0.87) hue-rotate(180deg)">
<img src="img/factorio-ram/write_d.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/write_d.png.webp" loading="lazy">
</span></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 9 Memory cell with write addressing</center><p></p>
<p>Here, <code>123</code> is used as the address of this cell. When the write address
signal <code>W</code> is set to <code>123</code> on the green wire, the memory cell
combinator gets disabled and the address combinator becomes the driver of red
wire. The value carried by signal <code>D</code> on the green wire would become
available on the red wire at the next tick.</p>
<p>When <code>W</code> signal is deasserted, the address combinator would continue to
drive the red wire for one more tick due to its delay. This would get seen by
the memory cell combinator as a one tick data on its red input, and the data
would become latched on red wire as it starts to drive the red wire at next
tick.</p>
<p>With write addressing is added, the memory cells essentially become a addressed
in, parallel out memory device, where other circuits can be connected to the red
wires of each cell to access stored data.</p>
<h3 id="readaddressing">Read Addressing</h3>
<p>To become an actual RAM, the reading would need to be addressable as well. This
can be achieved easily with another decider combinators.</p>
<p>Figure 10 shows the read address combinator added to the memory cell.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 30%"><p><img src="img/factorio-ram/read.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/read.png.webp" loading="lazy"></p></div>
<div markdown="1" style="width: 50%"><p><span style="filter: invert(0.87) hue-rotate(180deg)">
<img src="img/factorio-ram/read_d.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/read_d.png.webp" loading="lazy">
</span></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 10 Memory cell with read addressing</center><p></p>
<p>The mechanics of read addressing is relatively simple compared to write
addressing. When the read signal <code>R</code> of <code>123</code> is asserted on the
read address line, the read combinator gets activated. It then outputs the data
latched on the red line to its output at the next tick.</p>
<p>Multiple read address combinator can be connected to the data line to provide
more read ports.</p>
<h3 id="secconst">Constructing RAM from Cells</h3>
<p>The modular memory cell approach of this design makes it easy to construct
RAM of any size. By putting down multiple cells together and connect their input
and output lines, these cells form a larger RAM with shared addressing and data
line.</p>
<p>However, with just three combinators, the address would need to be set for each
cell individually. There is no in-game tool to sequentially assign values to
combinators, making it a tedious process to go through if manually. Fortunately,
Factorio has a blueprint system, which can be exported and imported from outside
sources. With a simple Python script, the RAM can be generated and configured
for any number of cells. This can greatly reduce the time spent on configuring a
new RAM instance. <a href="#seccode">Memory Cell Generation Code</a> contains the code to
generate RAM based on this 3-combinator cell design.</p>
<p>Figure 11 shows a RAM instance of 3 cells.</p>

<h3 id="secmssimpl">Variation: Multi-signal Support</h3>
<p>The above 3-combinator cell design only stores one signal, <code>D</code>. As
mentioned in <a href="#secmss">Multi-signal Support</a>, it useful to be able to store multiple
signals in each cell.</p>
<p>Simply configuring each combinators to output the special <em>Everything</em>
signal creates an issue. Without additional combinators, the write addressing
<code>W</code> would get passed along with data and looped back to the memory cell
combinator input, breaking the reset condition. Additionally, the data line
would get polluted with the addressing signals. In most case, this is not a
issue as most circuit would simply ignore the extra signals. Regardless, there
are still ways to prevent it from happening. Figure 12 shows the
design.</p>

<p></p><center>Figure 12 Memory cell with multi-signal support</center><p></p>
<p>The added arithmetic combinator on the read port is not part of the cell, only
one is needed for the whole RAM. Its purpose is to subtract away the read
address from the data line. When the read address is asserted on the address
line, the decider combinator on one of the cells would enable and forward all
its input at the next tick, including the addressing signal <code>R</code>.
This one tick delay matches with the delay of the arithmetic decider, which
outputs the negated address to the data line. The multi-output mechanics adds
the two addressing signal up, resulting to a net zero and effectively filters
out the address from data line.</p>
<p>Same concept is applied on the write port, except each cell would require its
own write address filter (since the data line here is not shared by all cells).</p>
<p>With the addition of 1 combinator per cell plus one for the combined RAM, it
makes the design more useful in Factorio application.</p>
<h3 id="secautoaddr">Variation: Automatic Address Assignment</h3>
<p>While writing a program that generates a RAM instance works, and can be more
convenient than placing the combinators in game, some players might prefer a
more vanilla way of playing. This design includes automatic address assignment
to help constructing RAM instances without needing different configurations on
each cell. Figure 13 shows the design.</p>
<p>One arithmetic combinator is added to each cell. The input of this combinator is
connected to the previous cell, and it increments the address signal,
<code>A</code>, of that cell by one. This incremented number is used by the new cell
as its address.</p>
<p>Note that in this design, the write address is required to be on both data and
address lines. This is because the limited choice of wire colours. The write
address combinator only has 2 inputs. Since it is undesired for the address
signal to be connected to other cells, it must be on a different input than
incoming address and data signals. The consequence is that the write address
must share the same line as write data. At the same time, the write data should
not be connected to the memory combinator directly. The two constraints combined
to require write address to be on both wires.</p>
<p>Other than the quirk described above, this design adds one combinator to each
cell. It is usually not a big issue, as players who prefer not to generate RAM
instances programmatically tend to create smaller RAMs that are more manageable
by hand. For that, one combinator per cell isn't much.</p>

<p>The only difference between the two tests is the starting condition. When
testing with respect to write address, data input starts at 1 while address
signal starts at 0; when testing with respect to data input, address starts at 1
while data starts at 0. In both cases, the address and data input both becomes
available at tick 1, and data output at tick 3. Note since the test setup uses
one single electrical pole to show the circuit network content, the input data
and output data would add together to 2 if both are being output. In both cases,
the data signal becomes 2 at tick 3, which shows a write latency of <code>3 - 1 = 2</code>
ticks.</p>

<p>The read and write address are both asserted at tick 1. Since the read latency
is one tick, the original data in the RAM becomes available one tick after, and
only until two ticks after address assertion the write delay follows up and the
output data becomes 2. Note in this test, the input data is not hooked to
the probing electrical pole, so the addition effect of having multiple data
output does not happen.</p>
<p>To sum up, when read and write address are asserted at the same time, the
original data would be available for the one following tick, then the newly
written data takes over on the output line after.</p>
<h3 id="operationspeed-1">Operation Speed</h3>
<p>Operation speed is the fastest rate the input can change while still operate
normally. Two aspects are tested: the speed of writing, and speed of reading.
The test setup is shown in Figure 17. Two small electrical poles
are used to probe the content of the circuit network. Two cells are used in this
setup to test the change of addresses. The content of each cell are read off
directly from the combinators instead of using electrical poles.</p>

at this speed, rather than treating the speed as unknown.</p>

<p>The first section of the data represent the test on write speed. The write
address and data are changed at maximum rate of once every tick. The data shows
the corresponding cells latches on the correct value after one tick of input
change (since the test data is obtained from the combinator directly, there is
no read latency). No intermediate values are present in any time.</p>
<p>The second section of the data represent the test on read speed, using the
latched values from write speed test. As the read address changes at one change
per tick, the read data signal changes correctly to output the stored values.
Similarly, no intermediate values are present in the data output.</p>
<p>From the data, it can be concluded that this RAM design can run at the maximum
speed of one change per tick, or 60 changes per second in normal game setting
without issues.</p>

<!-- {{{ Conclusion -->
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Circuit network in Factorio is very versatile, it can use to create simple
controls of factory to large complicated circuit. Using it to design a RAM is an
interesting engineering challenge with multiple factors to consider. The final
design has a minimal write latency of 2 ticks and read latency of 1 tick,
operating at 1 cycle per tick (60 cycles per second), allowing fast read and
write access. And with a modular design using three combinators per cell, it
achieves easy of construction, cost efficiency and extendability. It has a
deterministic behaviour during concurrent read-write. In addition, there are two
additional variations that can be used depending on the requirement of
application.</p>
<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ Application Example -->
<h3 id="secapp">Application Example: Train Content Tracking</h3>
<p>This is a circuit network that can keep track of the content of individual train
on the network. It utilizes a multi-signal variant of the RAM with multiple
stations sharing the same wire. Figure 18 shows an overview of the
system.</p>
<p><img src="img/factorio-ram/app.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/app.png.webp" loading="lazy">
</p><center>Figure 18 Train content tracking</center><p></p>
<p>Each train in the system has one slot reserved for fish as identification. The
amount of fish in the train sets the address in the RAM that would store the
content. Figure 19 shows the content in one of the train wagons.</p>
<p></p><center>
<img src="img/factorio-ram/train.png" alt="" width="50%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/train.png.webp" loading="lazy"><p></p>
<p></p></center>
<center>Figure 19 Content in one of the trains</center><p></p>
<p>Alternatively, the station can be configured to output a unique train ID to the
connected network. However, this train ID is more volatile and can change on its
own when the train configuration changes (eg., adding a wagon or having a wagon
destroyed from collision). Using a slot to manually set an ID is more reliable
at the cost of less capacity.</p>
<p>Each station is set to read the train content. The data is first passed through
a falling edge detector then sent to the global network. This provides a single
tick of address + data on the network to be used by the RAM. Figure
20 shows the edge detector used by each station.</p>
<div markdown="1" class="subfig"><div markdown="1" style="width: 30%"><p><img src="img/factorio-ram/train_filt.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="img/factorio-ram/train_filt.png.webp" loading="lazy"></p></div>

</span></p></div></div>
<p></p><center>Figure 20 Edge detector on each station</center><p></p>
<p>The global network connects all the stations to the central RAM. The RAM is a
multi-signal variation without automatic address assignment. Since the train can
carry more than one type of items, it is necessary to store multiple signals in
the RAM. This would make address assignment circuit too bulky to be constructed,
especially when the amount of cell is pretty low, with just one cell per train.</p>
<p>The fish signal is filtered out and converted to <code>W</code> write address
signal. This conversion is required because the RAM requires write address and
data to come from separate wires. Since the conversion from fish to <code>D</code>
does not destroy the original signal, this have an added effect of storing the
fish signal together with the other data. An extra add-zero combinator is used
alongside to match the delay of this address conversion. Figure
21 shows the conversion and delay circuit.</p>
<p>Once stored in the RAM, the train ID can then be selected using a constant
combinator and be viewed from an electric pole. Figure 21
shows the reading from central RAM of this system.</p>

<p>This system is not the most useful thing too build in the game, as there is
seldom the need to keep track of the content of each train individually.
However, it is still an interesting build to add to the factory for the fun and
challenge. If used in a busy situation, where multiple trains can leave in the
same tick, a arbitration system would also be added, but it is out of scope of
this report.</p>
